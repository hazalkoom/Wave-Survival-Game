# 🧟‍♂️ Wave Survival Game (Built with p5.js + p5.sound)

Welcome to **Wave Survival**, a 2D top-down survival game built using **p5.js** and the **p5.sound** library. This project demonstrates core gameplay mechanics like enemy waves, boss battles, combat, item pickups, scaling difficulty, and audio feedback — all done in JavaScript using creative coding tools.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

You are dropped into an endless battleground where enemies spawn in increasingly difficult waves. Your goal is to:

- Survive as many waves as possible
- Defeat mini-bosses and major bosses
- Pick up weapons and power-ups
- Use both melee and ranged attacks to hold your ground

The game dynamically gets harder over time, with larger, stronger enemies and increasingly frequent boss encounters.
